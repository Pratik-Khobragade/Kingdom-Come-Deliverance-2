### About This Game

Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is an open-world action role-playing game in which the protagonist is controlled from a first-person perspective.

The game world is twice as large as that of Kingdom Come: Deliverance; whereas the latter features a single connected world, the former encompasses two larger, freely explorable areas.

Missions and objectives are able to be managed in different ways, with NPCs and communities reacting respectively.

In turn, the reactions to the player character influence his daily life and character development.

The three skills Oratory, Charisma and Intimidation, that were applicable in dialogues with NPCs in the first game have been supplemented by Appearance, Coercion and Dominate.

The game features crossbows and early forms of firearms. The former can also be fired while riding.
